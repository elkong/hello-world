# hello-world
Just another repository

Hello, folks!

I'm Eric Kong, and yes, you've guessed it, I'm new to GitHub and am working off the Hello World guide.
Erm ... I like coding in Python and C++, and number theory, and jazz/orchestral composition and improvisation,
swing dancing, Golden Age science fiction, whistling, story-telling and world-building, conlanging,
and somehow putting all that together.

Good night - if you're reading this, it's probably far too late in the evening.
